# Pneumonia-Detection-using-chest-X-Ray

# Objective
To make a classifier that is able to distinguish between a person who has Pneumonia and a normal person using the X-Rays of their Lungs. These X-Rays were taken during regular check ups of these patients.

# Some details about the data
The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs.

# Results
Our model was able to distinguish between the patients that have Pneumonia successfully. The model gave an accuracy around 96% on the training data and had a validation accuracy of 82%. It was fed an image that it had never seen previously and made the correct prediction. But, i feel there is still some room for improvement.
